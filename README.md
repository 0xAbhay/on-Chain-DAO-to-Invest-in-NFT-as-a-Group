Introduction

On-Chain DAO is a decentralized platform built on blockchain technology that allows users to invest in NFTs from the FakeNFTmarketplace. Additionally, it offers the opportunity to participate in the decision-making process regarding the acquisition of CryptodevsNFT through a voting mechanism.
Features

    Investment in NFTs: On-Chain DAO provides users with the ability to invest in NFTs listed on the FakeNFTmarketplace.
    Voting Mechanism: Users can create proposals to buy CryptodevsNFT and participate in the voting process to determine whether to acquire it or not.
    Decentralized Decision-Making: The voting mechanism ensures that decisions regarding the acquisition of CryptodevsNFT are made collectively by the members of On-Chain DAO.

How It Works

    Investing in NFTs: Users can explore the FakeNFTmarketplace on the On-Chain DAO platform and choose the NFT they wish to invest in.
    Creating a Proposal: If users are interested in acquiring CryptodevsNFT, they can create a proposal detailing the NFT and its benefits.
    Voting Process: All members of On-Chain DAO can vote on the proposal. Each member's vote is weighted according to their stake in the DAO.
    Decision-Making: Once the voting period ends, the results are tallied, and the proposal is either accepted or rejected based on the majority vote.
    NFT Acquisition: If the proposal is accepted, the DAO proceeds with the acquisition of CryptodevsNFT from the FakeNFTmarketplace.
